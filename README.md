Introduction: 
The Health and Social care setting had been flawed with institutional abuse against old and young vulnerable adult either in their homes or in the care homes. As at 2020 during the pandemic according to UK care home population 2020| Statista [www.statistas.com] record 490,326 people live in caare homes in the unted kingdom compare to 2016 according to Laing and Buisson survey www.mha.org.uk accounts for approx 418,000 people. This population is only for older people age 65 and over living in care setting whereas 15.5million people age 60 and over live longer in their own homes making up to 23% of the UK population and even more 3.2million age 80 and over inluding almost 600,000 of 90 and over are living longer in the expence of family caregivers. 
On the other hand in similar situation for young vulnerable adult is different with the care setting according to www.health.org.uk
Adults aged 18–64 are a core part of the social care system in England. They make up around a third of care users and over half of local authority spending on social care.The care they receive is very different to older people – including more support in the community. 
The proportion of younger adults reporting a disability increased from 14% in 2007/08 to 18% in 2017/18. Whencombined with population growth, the number rose by 35%. The number of people with severe learning disabilities is projected to increase by 34% between 2017
and 2027.
