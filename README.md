# Introduction: 

The Health and Social care setting had been flawed with institutional abuse against old and young vulnerable adult either in their homes or in the care homes. As at 2020 during the pandemic according to UK care home population 2020| Statista [www.statistas.com] record 490,326 people live in caare homes in the unted kingdom compare to 2016 according to Laing and Buisson survey www.mha.org.uk accounts for approx 418,000 people. This population is only for older people age 65 and over living in care setting whereas 15.5million people age 60 and over live longer in their own homes making up to 23% of the UK population and even more 3.2million age 80 and over inluding almost 600,000 of 90 and over are living longer in the expence of family caregivers.


On the other hand in similar situation for young vulnerable adult is different with the care setting according to www.health.org.uk
Adults aged 18–64 are a core part of the social care system in England. They make up around a third of care users and over half of local authority spending on social care.The care they receive is very different to older people – including more support in the community. 
The proportion of younger adults reporting a disability increased from 14% in 2007/08 to 18% in 2017/18. When combined with population growth, the number rose by 35%. The number of people with severe learning disabilities is projected to increase by 34% between 2017 and 2027.
The population of vulnerable young adult renting their home or living with family according to the https://www.ons.gov.uk/ The UK Government says it wants to increase the accessibility of affordable housing for young people, while other political parties, including the Opposition, have also raised the issue.  The percentage of 25 to 34 year old householders renting their home has surpassed those who own their homes over the last decade. There has been a noticeable increase in renting since the early 2000s. This may be due to increased demand for rented housing as house prices increase and an increased supply of privately rented housing from a growing number of buy-to-let investors. However not every vulnerable young adukt are so fortunate to buy their own property theincrease in renting has been largest for householders who are aged 20 to 24 or live with family members with population of 618,000 more young adults living with their parents/carers/caregivers in 2015 than in 1996 - 3.3 million compared with 2.7 million.
Fact aabout carers according to carer CarersUK  2011 Census almost 4 million of the UK’s carers care for 1-19 hours each week whilst 775,000 provide 20-49 hours and 1.4 million provide 50 hours or more unpaid care.9 There is also strong evidence of a trend towards individual carers providing more hours of care per week. The numbers caring round the clock (i.e. for 50 or more hours or more each week) are rising faster than the general carer population - an increase of 25% in the last ten years compared to an 11% rise in the total number of carers.

Analysis of the Understanding Society data also suggests relatives providing more intensive support - showing increase in the hours of care provided, between 2011/13 and 2015/17. There was a 2-percentage point increase in the proportion of adults who help parents with activities ofdaily living (ADLs) According to the Personal Social Services Survey of Adult Carers in England 2016-1711, over a third of carers (36%) are caring for over 100 hours a week. 13% of carers care for 19 hours or less a week; 15% care for between 20 and 49 hours a week and almost 15% care for between 50 and 100 hours a week. However the impact of caring is not just dictated by the number of hours of care provided. If a carer is working full-time, combining caring with looking after young children, or having to travel long distances to provide care, then even having to provide a few hours of care a week can have a serious impact on their life. https://www.carersuk.org/for-professionals/policy/policy-library

# Understanding of who Family Caregivers are
# i. Who are family caregivers

A family caregiver was defined as “a person responsible for the prevention and treatment of family members' illness or disability” [21]. ... Family caregivers under 18 years old were excluded as well as patients under 65 years old, with a curable disease and independent in self-care.25 May 2020 https://bmcpalliatcare.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12904-020-00583-4#:~:text=A%20family%20caregiver%20was%20defined,or%20disability%E2%80%9D%20%5B21%5D.&text=Family%20caregivers%20under%2018%20years,and%20independent%20in%20self%2Dcare.

# ii. What are the daily challenges as a family caregiver 

# Gendered caregiving: 
Although caregiving is still predominantly a female occupation, there is growing evidence of a greater role played by men in caregiving. But, despite increasing care provision by sons and husbands, daughters and wives continue to provide more care. Likewise, grandfathers are increasingly involved in childcare provision but not to the same extent as
grandmothers.

# Health and well-being of caregivers: 
Informal carers are 2.5 times more likely to experience psychological distress than non-carers, and working carers are two to three times more likely to suffer poor health than those without caregiving responsibilities.

# Ethnic minority caregiving: 
There are about 130,000 family carers from ethnic minority backgrounds providing care for a minimum of 20 hours per week in England and Wales. Whereas intergenerational care is predominantly delivered by women, men are mainly involved in spousal care. Family carers from ethnic minorities are less likely to access health care or social services, which is a result of lack of awareness in combination with perceived 5 personal/family responsibility, experiences of stigmatisation and past negative experiences with
health and social care services, particularly in the case of dementia.

# Regional variation in caregiving: 
Family care is more often provided in the rural areas of North and South Wales, and in parts of North West, North East and East England, as well as in socio-economically deprived areas, which is a reflection of both greater need and greater availability of informal caregivers. Family care provided by ethnic minority carers is more common in the urban areas of Greater London and the West Midlands.

# Working carers:
Working carers are typically aged 52–64 years. Difficulties experienced by working carers include lack of time, restricted opening hours, excessive stress and resulting health problems, family conflicts, work-related conflicts and financial pressures. Reconcilingemployment and caregiving commitments is generally easier in the public than in the private sector, as well as in larger companies than in SMEs. Working carers stress the importance of their managers being approachable, flexible and sympathetic – but they also demand more legal rights, such as paid care leave, flexible working hours, flexible opening hours, respite care and use of day-care centres.

# Dementia care: 
One of the greatest challenges of family care is caregiving for someone suffering from dementia. As the illness progresses the caregiving burden grows, and the relationship with the care recipient becomes increasingly strained, often resulting in communication problems and conflicts. Social isolation follows. Eventually, many dementia carers need professional help from care services and rely on them to an increasing extent. The annual costs of dementia in the UK amount to £26.3 billion in care costs, of which £12.4 billion are met by informal carers. Numbers of dementia patients have been projected to double from currently 800,000 to more than 1.7 million by mid-century (although recent evidence suggests that the increase may be smaller due to reduced risk factors).

# iii. What support is available if the Local Authority falsely alleged family caregivers of safeguarding issues?
When institutional abuse occurs from a socail worker and Support service, it is so challenging and so devastating on both friend and family. Most expecially when no wrong or allegation had not be made on the family caregive over 2weeks that family had been falsely alleged of what doen not exist insomuch the child is removed away from the family and no contact made with vulnerable young adult and the family. An example of happens is attaches as a link

# iv. What is the impact of the COVID on both vulnarable young adult and famile caregivers | https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/


In general, parents and carers of children and young people have reported a negative impact on their mental health and wellbeing, with observable deterioration after the implementation of national lockdowns and home education. However, some subgroups have shown greater vulnerability to the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic than other subgroups, including adults in single-caregiver households, families on low incomes, and households with children and young people with special educational needs or neurodevelopmental disorders. Many of these subgroups have had to take on roles that might have otherwise been offered by school-based pastoral support and mental health professionals.

As the pandemic unfolded and lockdown measures followed, there has been a public health focus on promoting wellbeing through managing (restricting) food and alcohol consumption and introducing optimal exercise routines. Although laudable and led by evidence that highlights substantial increases in problematic drinking and lifestyle behaviours during lockdown, the confirmed links between obesity and lockdown measures, and the increased risk of death,38, 39 this focus has been complex for people with emerging or established eating disorders

Carers are often involved in facilitating the positive behavioural change of care recipients using different strategies, including motivational interviewing and anxiety management. With the transfer of specialist eating disorder services to remote access provision, health-care providers have been increasingly reliant on the involvement of family carers to support care recipients with accessing their physical health checks (eg, weight checks and blood tests). This increasing reliance can also affect the caregiving relationship and support needs of the carer.

For individuals, particularly young children and young people, with complex neurodevelopmental needs, such as autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, and other neurodevelopmental conditions, their interface with the world is often mediated via their carers. Family carers are frequently the chief negotiators and advocates of which services their child can access, including those in the family home. This liaison with statutory, voluntary, and third-sector service providers can leave carers as de facto case managers, which is a considerable responsibility, particularly for single-parent households.

The pandemic and changes to service delivery have increased uncertainty for nearly everyone. However, for specific groups (eg, people with autism spectrum disorder) who depend on routines, consistency, predictability, and familiarity to function optimally in their environments, the effect of these changes on their behaviours and wellbeing and the direct and indirect implications for the wellbeing and needs of informal carers, have not been fully considered.41, 42 For example, it is known that lockdown restrictions on educational access and specialist learning provision, and the cessation of community-based resources (eg, swimming and soft play), which are essential for families in managing the daily and unique challenges of their caregiving role, have left many families feeling desperate and isolated.43, 44 Sources of support (eg, child care, individual help, and educational provision) that parents might have used before the pandemic, and that supported their efforts in managing the effect of their child's complex needs on their wellbeing, have largely disappeared.45 Compounding this effect, sources of support for carers themselves have also been less available than they were before the pandemic. In addition, some young adults living in supported residential-group settings have returned to their family of origin, initially as a temporary measure, to minimise the risk of virus transmission. Such developments have provided new challenges and stressors for both carers and recipients.43, 44

In young children and adults, complex neurodevelopmental needs will often co-occur with other morbidities, including mental health conditions (eg, anxiety or eating disorders) and physical health conditions, which adds to the challenges of the caregiving role.46, 47 Although not exclusive to, or applicable to, all children and adults with complex neurodevelopmental needs, the UK national lockdowns, with their service closures that reduced the population in public places and were associated with an overall quieter and slower daily pace of life, were believed to have led to reductions in common sources of anxiety and stress for some individuals. Thus, the easing of lockdown measures and re-entry into normal life (eg, school) can be linked with mixed emotions for carers. For some carers, the end of lockdown will be a return to old challenges (eg, supporting a young person with mental health difficulties and social vulnerabilities with school attendance). However, understanding of and adherence to lockdown rules has sometimes presented unique challenges for carers, such as care recipients being over-compliant or having an overliteral interpretation of public health guidance. Some families have dealt with situations in which care recipients have chosen not to leave their homes in any permissible circumstances (eg, shopping) or not to see other people, including family carers, as part of their overliteral interpretation of public health guidance. In these situations, family carers have had to create strategies to help care recipients avoid additional health and social disabilities and source creative ways to deliver usual care.

In addition, there are stressors for carers waiting for the start or completion of the diagnostic process for care recipients with complex neurodevelopmental needs. In some geographical areas and services, waiting times for diagnostic assessments, which were already 2–3 years long, have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.48 This increase in waiting times partly reflects the transition that services have had to make to adjust to and integrate the collection of diagnostic data using remote methods that were previously gathered across different settings, including the family home and school. Since diagnosis is often a requirement for accessing specialist services and educational support, diagnostic delays exacerbate the stress exposure and strain for carers and the vulnerability of the family unit.
